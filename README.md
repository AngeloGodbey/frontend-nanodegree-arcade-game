# JavaScript Frogger Game

## How to load the game

Click [here](https://super-ming.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)
to load the game.  

You can also clone the repository to your local machine to run the
application locally and open the index.html file in your browser to load
the game. Click on the Clone/Download button towards the top of this
repository for options.

## How to play

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your player around! Your goal
is to reach the water without touching any of the enemy bugs. If your
player grazes one of the bugs, your player will land back on the grass and
you will have to start all over, so don't do it. Your player may get a
wardrobe change, gender change, or both, so try not to touch the bugs if
you're not ok with that.
