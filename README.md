# JavaScript Frogger Game

## How to play

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move your player around! Your goal is to
reach the water without touching any of the enemy bugs. If your player grazes
one of the bugs, your player will land back on the grass and you will have to
start all over, so don't do it.
